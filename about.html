            <h2>My Biography</h2>
            <p>My name is Andrew Yang, and I was born on August 18, 2003, in the United States. My early years were spent in the diverse and vibrant environment of my birthplace. However, due to personal reasons, my family relocated to Taiwan, a move that greatly enriched my cultural perspective and provided me with unique life experiences. </p>
            <p>I am currently pursuing a major in Computer Science at National Dong Hwa University. The field of computer science, known for its rapid evolution and significant impact on the modern world, captivates my interest and allows me to develop a robust skill set in technology and innovation. My academic journey has been characterized by a dedication to learning and a passion for solving complex problems through programming and software development. <br></p>
            <p>Growing up in a family where education and creativity were highly valued, I was deeply influenced by my parents' professions. My mother, a dedicated teacher, instilled in me a love for learning and the importance of knowledge, while my father, an architect, inspired a sense of creativity and precision. These influences are evident in my meticulous approach to both my studies and my hobbies. <br></p>
            <p>Music has played a significant role in my life from a young age. I began learning the piano and violin during middle school, an endeavor that not only honed my musical talents but also taught me discipline and patience. The intricate nature of mastering these instruments mirrors the complexity of computer science, a parallel that I have come to appreciate deeply. <br></p>
            <p>In addition to my musical pursuits, I am an avid basketball player. The sport provides me with a balance to my academic and musical interests, offering a physical outlet and a means to develop teamwork and strategic thinking. My participation in basketball has fostered a sense of camaraderie and an appreciation for healthy competition. <br></p>
            <p>My relocation to Taiwan and subsequent immersion in its culture have profoundly shaped my worldview. This experience has endowed me with a unique perspective, blending Western and Eastern cultural elements, which I apply to both my personal and professional life. My ability to navigate and integrate these diverse cultural landscapes has become one of my most defining characteristics. <br></p>
            <p>Looking ahead, I aspire to leverage my expertise in computer science to make meaningful contributions to the field of technology. My ultimate goal is to develop innovative solutions that address real-world problems, improving lives and advancing society. Driven by a deep-seated belief in the power of technology and education, I am committed to lifelong learning and continuous self-improvement. <br></p>
            <p>In summary, I am a multifaceted individual with a rich tapestry of experiences and interests. My journey from the United States to Taiwan, combined with my academic achievements and personal passions, has crafted a well-rounded and forward-thinking individual poised to make significant impacts in the world of technology and beyond. With a strong foundation in music, sports, and academics, I embody the spirit of perseverance, creativity, and global awareness.</p>
